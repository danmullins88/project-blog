title: This is my latest post

I have done more research into p5.js and have started to work with particle systems. This is just as complicated to learn, but it's the closest I have come to what I initially visualized. Before exploring particle systems I created a crazy sketch that analyzed waveform and frequency. It was also interctive with the movement of the users mouse. It looks fun, but I would like to achieve something that visioned in the first place. After some feedback, the spirograph on p5.js was suggested. It uses simple transformations to create a Spirograph-like effect with interlocking circles (called sines). This was also exciting for me because it created random ellipses on the page and had the capability of being analysed and becoming something I visioned at the start. 

I think I have lots of directions I could head in, so this weekend I'm going to nail down a direction and just try and complete it. I don't have time to research much more. If I will be presenting on Friday, I would like to add in the upload file section of the website.
