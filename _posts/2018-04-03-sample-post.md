title: This is my first post

This week I began to finalise my idea, — An online music platform that lets users upload music and search through popular songs on the Billboards, and be able to perform aesthetic interactive music visuals. 
Initially I wanted my platform to synchronise with the users personal music subscriptions (e.g. Apple Music, Spotify), however, that was an unrealistic goal and was cut from my final version. 
I’m attempting to explore my interests in music and particle systems, which can work together to create aesthetically attractive music visuals. As I am also interested in editorial design and typography, I’d like to incorporate that into the design of my online experience.

After finalising my idea, I started by making sketches and an XD version of my website, so that I can easily visual my final product. I wanted 4 different pages, “The Hot 10”, “Upload”,  “Visual Gallery”, and “About”. “The Hot 10” section would show some of the most popular songs on the charts at that moment, and then users would be able to click on them to see music visuals on a separate page. “Upload” section would give the user a chance to upload their own music and produce visuals, however, after some feedback, this section might be to difficult to finish, but I’d like to give it a go if I’m able to finish everything else early. “Visual Gallery” section would show stills of previous visualisations, incase users are curious to see what this platform can produce. “About” section will just be a short description about the platform. 

I also worked on the processing for my visualiser and I hope to be half way done with it by next class. I also need to find out how to convert it into Javascript and do some in depth research into how to perfect my interactive visuals.
