title: This is my third post

During this week I was still struggling to link my processing file to javascript, even though I followed every instruction correctly on processingjs.org. There seemed to be a problem with a library I was using, Minim, which turns out is very hard to link to website design. Therefor I have decided to redo my design on p5.js, meaning I would have to rewrite my designs, however, I am hopping this would mean it will be easier for me to achieve my targets for the website, after version 1. 

I have taken into consideration what others have said about my proposal and initial designs of the website and have implemented them into my initial version of the website. By Friday I am hoping to be finished with the layout and design of the website, with an initial test of the visual ready also. 

During class on Friday, I would like to polish off linking my visual to the website and learn how to analyse my website to achieve my KPI. I haven’t defined my win for my KPI, however a couple options could be:

- Users spend over a minute listening and observing visuals on the visualiser page (will hopefully tell me that users are intrigued)
- Users have explored 5 or more of the songs listened under “The Hot 10” and have attempted to upload their own mp3 files.
- Each user has explored the website thoroughly
