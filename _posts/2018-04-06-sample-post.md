title: This is my second post

Since last class, I have continued to work on my Processing code for my music visualiser, and have come up with a couple of variations. However, I’m still a bit confused on how to convert processing to javascript, I tried to research it before class and found that I have to download several things for it to work or link several files together, but it wasn’t very clear to me. I’m aiming to have that resolved by next class. 

I did some user testing of my XD file, which looks like the final product, with some of my friends. Some of their suggestions were: 

- They loved the explosion of colour on the music visualisation page, as the rest of the website is black and white
    - The cursor should be colourful too throughout the website, to add that glimpse of colour
- The font size of the subtitles on each page is too small, so I would need to enlarge them
- They thought the structure and setup of the website was great
- Some thought the font wasn’t doing it for them - it needs more attitude and feel more cohesive with the musical aspect? A Sans would work better (also a bold type) in their opinion.
- Cover page should be simple, but have fun interactive elements
    - Cover page should give the user an idea of what to look forward to in these visual interactions
- A download feature, were users can download a gif of the visual or screenshot to keep 
- Visual Gallery to have visual screenshot with specific song names that they correlate to

For the following class, I’d like to have a visual setup on the webpage and test if it works smoothly. I need to push the visuals further and document user flow. And also put together the simple functionality of the whole website, with links to each page and menu.
