title: This is my fourth post

By last class I did manage to have a very simple p5.js music analyser finished, however, it was difficult for me to learn a new language in a couple of days and wrap my head around it. I would of course like to have an awesome visual for Tuesdays presentations, but realistically its going to take some time and lots of trial and error to get to where I would like to be with these visualisations. I will present the best visuals that I have come up with on Tuesday. 

Other than that, I’m nearly done with my website - the layout and design. Apart from the visuals it will be completely polished off. I’m thinking that I should have two versions, where I would explore different typefaces as I am unsure of which direction to go in, because I have a typeface that I like for this website (Baskerville) and a couple of people that I have asked like it too, but there was a fair bit of feedback telling me that maybe the typeface should change to a Sans not a Serif. 

I will also add in Google analytics to analyse my website and try and achieve my KPI.
