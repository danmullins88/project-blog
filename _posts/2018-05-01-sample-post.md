title: This is my fifth post

I have further tried to debug the processing.js files in sublime. I managed to get the canavas, audio, and a circle on the webpage, however, I don't think I will have enough time to complete this file for our presentations. So I am planning to begin from scratch and make a visualizer that meets my goals.

By Friday, I will have the interactive cover finished and the visualizer will be half way finished too. I want the website to look cohesive and fully functional on Friday.
